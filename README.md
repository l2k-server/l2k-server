# L2K SERVER
L2K is open-source server emulator of one famous korean MMORPG. Now in Kotlin!
At the moment Interlude version is being developed

## Requirements 

* Java 21
* Postgresql
* 2106 and 7777 ports opened
* Interlude client

## Local (DEV) launch

### Game client

Login server will start at 2106 port, so you'll have to modify l2.ini file (for example, with L2FileEdit). Set ServerAddr=127.0.0.1 and Port=2106
